/**
 * `next/image` refuses to optimize any host it hasn't been told about —
 * every absolute-URL origin a real `<Image>` `src` can point to has to be
 * listed here. That includes the app's *own* origin: `remotePatterns` is
 * matched against the URL, not against "is this cross-origin", so an
 * absolute `${NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/...` src is refused exactly like a
 * third-party one would be. Read directly from `process.env` (not the
 * validated `serverEnv()`/`clientEnv()` parsers) because this file runs
 * before the app's module graph exists.
 *
 * The origins themselves come from `media/public-origins.ts` — the same
 * function each storage provider's `getPublicUrl` derives its base from, so
 * the allowlist and the URLs cannot drift apart. They had drifted (P14):
 * this list previously named `MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` only, so `STORAGE_PROVIDER="s3"` with no CDN in
 * front of the bucket — a supported, ordinary starting configuration —
 * served every image from the bucket's own host and `next/image` refused
 * all of them. That module is deliberately dependency-free so importing it
 * here pulls in nothing else.
 *
 * `images.unsplash.com` is the one host that is not derived from
 * configuration, so it stays written out here: P03/P04's known, documented
 * case, the 15 migrated-catalog MediaAssets that P04's migration script
 * couldn't download in this sandbox (network egress blocked) and which are
 * still `EXTERNAL` rows whose `storageKey` is the original Unsplash URL —
 * see `media/cdn.ts`. Nothing else should add a host here by convention.
