/**
 * P06 bootstrap — creates the very first admin account (`OWNER` role, i.e.
 * Super Admin). This is the *only* path that may ever create an admin user
 * out of nothing: there is no signup form, no seed data, and no hardcoded
 * account anywhere in this codebase (the legacy `admin/admin123` account
 * was deleted in P00 and must never return).
 *
 * Credentials come only from environment variables, read directly from
 * `process.env` here and nowhere else — `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and
 * `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are deliberately excluded from
 * `env.schema.ts`'s validated `serverEnv()` (see the comment there) so they
 * can never leak into a page, a log line, or any code path that runs as
 * part of the app itself — this script is the one place they are read, and
 * the process exits the moment it's done with them.
 *
 * Idempotent: running it again against an email that already exists resets
 * that user's password and re-asserts OWNER/active, rather than failing —
 * so it doubles as "reset the bootstrap admin's password" if it's ever
 * lost. It never creates a second bootstrap account by accident.
 *
 * Run with: pnpm db:create-admin
 *   BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=owner@example.com BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD='...' pnpm db:create-admin
