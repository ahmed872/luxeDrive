/**
 * Who may open an order (P10 §14).
 *
 * Two answers, and no third:
 *
 *   a signed-in customer  — authorised by their session, scoped in the query
 *   a guest               — authorised by an access token they were issued
 *                           at checkout
 *
 * The token lives in an httpOnly cookie and nowhere else. It is deliberately
 * *not* put in the URL: a link in the address bar leaks through the referrer
 * header, browser history, screenshots and shared links, and an order
 * contains a name, a phone number and a home address. The cookie the browser
 * cannot read is the same mechanism the guest cart already uses (P09), so
 * this is the architecture's existing answer rather than a new one.
 *
 * The cost is stated plainly: a guest who clears their cookies, or who opens
 * the link on another device, cannot reach the order any more. Recovering it
 * needs a verified email link, which requires the notification delivery P13
 * owns — building half of it here would mean an unsendable email or a
 * weaker token, and neither is worth it.
