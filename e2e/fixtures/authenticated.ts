/**
 * A real login, performed once (cached per worker) and reused as storage
 * state — Playwright's documented pattern for "reuse signed-in state." Every
 * admin-auth-flow test still submits the real login form for real (that's
 * the point of those tests); this is only for tests that need to already
 * *be* signed in to check something else (axe, keyboard nav, permission
 * gating) — logging in fresh via the UI for each of those would multiply
 * real `authorize()` calls against the real login rate limiter (P06's own
 * defense working exactly as intended), which is real security, not a test
 * bug, but would make an unrelated axe check spuriously trip the rate limit
 * it isn't testing.

/**
 * Chromium makes its own requests to Google endpoints (variations, autofill,
 * component updates) that no test needs. Behind an egress proxy that holds
 * such connections open rather than refusing them, they never settle, the
 * page's `load` event never fires, and every navigation stalls until the
 * test times out — a browser problem that reads exactly like a slow
 * application. Nothing under test is off-origin, so anything that isn't the
 * app under test is refused outright.
